    <p class="about_me">
      I am a high school student, and is planning to become a software engineer.
I live in Chicago with my parents and two sisters. Since I was introduced to coding
      my interest in technology increased. Now I want to pursue career in tech fields
      by doing a major in computer science. Besides my passion and love for coding,
      I always enjoy math because it challenges my thinking. I hope that one day
      I will be able to have a job that invovles both: math and coding.
